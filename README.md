## Rules of the game

[https://koodipahkina.monad.fi/app/docs](https://koodipahkina.monad.fi/app/docs)

The game begins by removing 9 cards from a deck of 35 cards. 

4 players | 44 coins | 33 numbered cards in the range 3 - 35

Of the remaining 24 cards, one is turned over in the middle of the game board. Each card you draw increases your score by the value of the card. The exception is consecutive cards, which only increase your score by the value of the lowest card in the series (see example below).

Each player is given 11 coins at the beginning of the game, which can be used for betting. You can bet a coin on a card on your turn, which then passes to the next player and you do not have to draw a card.

When scoring, the number of coins in your hand is subtracted from the points accumulated by the cards in your hand. The player with the fewest points wins the game.

Example hand:
1, 2, 3, 12, 16, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 8 coins = Set (1, 2, 3) + 12 + 16 + Set (24, 25, 26, 27, 28) - 8 = 1 + 12 + 16 + 24 - 8 = 25 points


## Scoring

 - Cards are plus points; Coins are minus points
 - Cards are scored so that, of sets of consecutive numbers, only the lowest card in each set counts
 - The goal is to collect as few points as possible
